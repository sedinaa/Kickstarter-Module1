- Based on the data provided, play/theater showed the highest success rates. Kickstarters within the technology/wearable parent category showed the highest failure rates. Of the most successful category (plays) Kickstarters initiated during May/June showed highest success rates. Campaigns initiated during November/December showed highest failure rates. US campaigns of noted success have average/mean goal amount of $5,049 and IQR of $3,500 (quartile range of $5,000 to $1500);pledge mean of $5,602 with IQR of $3,699 (quartile range of $5,699 to $2,000). Failed US campaigns averaged success goals of $10,554 and IQR of $8,000 (quartile range of $10,000 to $2,000);pledge average/mean of $559 and IQR of $492(quartile ranging from $501 to $9). For future successful Kickstarter campaigns, it would be recommended that the campaign be a play/theater project, initiated during May/June with goal of about $3,500, not exceeding about $5,000.

### Challenge 
* Data analysis to understand influence of campaign length on success/failure.

* ![Outcomes_Based_on_Launch_Dates1](path/to/Outcomes_Based_on_Launch_Dates1.png)
- Recommendations based on data: Based on the data provided, Kickstarter campaigns, specifcially plays, with launch dates during the May/June period showed the highest rate of success. Play Kickstarter campaigns launched in December showed the highest failure rates. Kickstarter campaigns with goals ranging from 20K to 45K showed lowest success rates while goals ranging from >1K to 9,999, with specific peak between 1K to 4,999, showed highest rate of success.
